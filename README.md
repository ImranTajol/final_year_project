**Project Title: Prototyping Programmable IoT Watering System for Large Vegetable Farm**

**Aim:** To provide a programmable/customizable watering mechanism for different plots in a vegetable farm.
**Objectives:**
      * To design an automated, efficient and cost-effective watering system for large vegetable farm incorporating IoT.
      * To supply optimum amount of water for crops based on its age.
      * To develop a controller mechanism for farmer to operate farm remotely.                
      * To develop a customizable and flexible watering mechanism for each subplots within a farm.
